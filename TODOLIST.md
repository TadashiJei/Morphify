# Morphify Project TODOLIST

This document tracks the development progress of the Morphify project.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Backend & Smart Contracts
- **[x] Core Smart Contracts:** Developed and tested `LoanMarketplace`, `LoanContract`, `Reputation`, and `DisputeResolution` contracts.
- **[x] Hardhat Testing:** All 27 Hardhat tests are passing, ensuring core contract functionality.
- **[x] Oracle Service:** Developed an oracle in Node.js to act as a bridge between the blockchain and external services.
- **[x] On-Chain Updates:** Oracle successfully updates user credit scores in the `Reputation` contract.

### Machine Learning
- **[x] Credit Score Model:** Trained and saved a machine learning model (`credit_score_model.joblib`) to predict credit scores.
- **[x] ML API Server:** Built and debugged a Flask API (`app.py`) to serve the ML model via a `/predict` endpoint.

### Integration & Bug Fixes
- **[x] Oracle-API Integration:** Successfully connected the oracle to the ML API.
- **[x] Resolved 500 Error:** Fixed the critical feature mismatch bug that caused a `500 Internal Server Error` in the API.

### Project Management
- **[x] Version Control:** Initialized a Git repository and pushed the project to GitHub.
- **[x] Documentation:** Created a basic `README.md` and this `TODOLIST.md`.

## ⏳ Pending Tasks

### Frontend Development
- **[ ] UI/UX Design:** Design a user-friendly interface for the lending platform.
- **[ ] Build Frontend:** Develop the frontend application (e.g., using React, Vue, or Svelte).
- **[ ] Wallet Integration:** Connect the frontend to users' wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
- **[ ] Smart Contract Interaction:** Integrate frontend with smart contracts for loan requests, funding, and repayments.
- **[ ] Display Credit Scores:** Show users their Morph Credit Score.

### Backend & Oracle Enhancements
- **[ ] Real Data Integration:** Replace mock user data in the oracle with a system to fetch real on-chain data for dynamic scoring.

### Deployment
- **[ ] Deployment Scripts:** Create robust deployment scripts for the smart contracts.
- **[ ] Testnet Deployment:** Deploy all components (contracts, oracle, API) to a public testnet for end-to-end testing.
- **[ ] Mainnet Deployment:** Plan and execute the mainnet launch.

### Security & Optimization
- **[ ] Security Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the smart contracts before mainnet deployment.
- **[ ] Gas Optimization:** Analyze and optimize smart contract functions to reduce gas costs.

### Documentation
- **[ ] User Guides:** Write guides for lenders and borrowers.
- **[ ] Developer Documentation:** Create detailed documentation for the codebase and APIs.
