# Morphify Credit Score Model

## Overview
This directory is dedicated to the research, development, and deployment of the "Morph Credit Score" model. The primary objective is to create a dynamic, fair, and predictive credit scoring system based on a user's on-chain data, providing a viable alternative to traditional credit scores.

## Technology Stack
*   **Language:** [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   **Core Libraries:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
*   **Deep Learning (Optional):** [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
*   **API Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

## The "Morph Credit Score" Model

### Goal
The model's goal is to assess the creditworthiness of a user by analyzing their history and behavior on the blockchain. A higher score will indicate a lower risk profile, enabling access to better loan terms.

### Potential Input Features (On-Chain Data)
*   **Wallet Age & Activity:** Age of the wallet, frequency of transactions.
*   **Stablecoin History:** Volume, frequency, and consistency of stablecoin transactions.
*   **Loan Repayment Performance:** History of loan repayments on the Morphify platform (e.g., timeliness, completion rate, number of loans repaid).
*   **DeFi Interaction:** Engagement with other DeFi protocols (e.g., providing liquidity, staking).
*   **DAO Participation:** Involvement in governance on Morph or other platforms.

### Modeling Approach
1.  **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Start with a transparent, rule-based or linear regression model. This ensures interpretability and fairness in the initial stages.
2.  **Future Iterations:** Explore more complex models like Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) or Neural Networks to capture non-linear relationships in the data and improve predictive accuracy.

## Architecture

1.  **Data Pipeline:** A set of scripts responsible for collecting on-chain data for given wallet addresses, cleaning it, and engineering relevant features.
2.  **Model Training:** Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for model experimentation, training, and evaluation.
3.  **API Service:** A lightweight API that exposes a single endpoint (e.g., `/score/{wallet_address}`). The backend will call this endpoint to retrieve the Morph Credit Score for a user.

## Long-Term Vision
*   To enhance the model's accuracy by incorporating more diverse data sources.
*   To integrate privacy-preserving technologies (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) to allow users to leverage off-chain data (like utility payments or mobile money history) without compromising their privacy.
